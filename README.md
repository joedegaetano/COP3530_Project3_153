This program was coded in python using the PyQT5 and Pandas python libraries, and uses the public Yelp dataset.  In order to effectively run this program, take the following steps:

  1) Install PyQT5 and Pandas python libraries
     * PyQT5 Download Guide: https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
     * Pandas Download Guide: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
  2) Download the Yelp public data set: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
  3) Extract the file entitled yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
  4) Copy this file into the same directory that the main.py and helper_functions.py are in

Once the above steps are completed, the program should be fully executable.  Please contact Joe DeGaetano (j.degaetano@ufl.edu) or Kristian O'Connor (kristianoconnor@ufl.edu) with any questions.

NOTE:  The Bogo (Stupid) Sort is not a practical sorting method to use as it can run for an extremely long time.  If you try to execute this sorting algorithm against anything other than a very small data set, you will likely have to force quit the program to get it to stop.  If you are interested in executing the Bogo sort, run it against a very small subset of the data, like Best Restaurants in Indian Shores, FL.
