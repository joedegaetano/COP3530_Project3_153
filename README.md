This program was coded in python using the PyQT and Pandas python libraries, and uses the public Yelp dataset.  In order to effectively run this program, take the following steps:

  1) Install PyQT5 and Pandas python libraries
     * PyQT5 Download Guide: https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download
     * Pandas Download Guide: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
  2) Download the Yelp public data set: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
  3) Extract the file entitled yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
  4) Copy this file into the same directory that the main.py and helper_functions.py are in

Once the above steps are completed, the program should be fully executable.  Please contact Joe DeGaetano (j.degaetano@ufl.edu) or Kristian O'Connor (kristianoconnor@ufl.edu) with any questions.
